This is about making a  bash script that create a file and increment the sub-folders name e.g c1 c2 c3 and so on .

Obviously we'll need to go with a mkdir -p ( parent directory) and -v ( for keeping track of what going on)
We'll need a loop to increment the files e.g

Folder 1 (Subject : Mathematics)
  sub_folder : class 1    sub_folder : class 2  sub_folder : class 4 
  
  
  #!/bin/bash
